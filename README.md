# Cucumber JS With Asciidoc

! Attention !
- This feature is still pending validation from Cucumber / Gherkin team
- This feature currently works only for Cucumber-js

This project illustrates an example on how to extend the basic gherkin format by adding a "flavor", allowing us to write user stories in ASCII Doctor format.

## Why
Ascii Doctor is a great and very rich formatting language that can be used for technical and business documentation.

Combining asciidoc and gherkin we can achieve more complete "Living" documentation and easily integrate our features into solutions like Antora etc.
